RUST PARTICIPANTS — Prerequisites & Struggles
Learning Mindset
● Be ready to:
○ Read error messages carefully
○ Unlearn certain habits from Python or JavaScript
○ Think with precision (Rust forces explicit, safe choices)
Mental Model: Stack vs Heap
● At least a conceptual idea of how memory works:
○ What's stored in the stack vs the heap
○ What is a pointer/reference in high-level terms
Why? Rust emphasizes memory safety, ownership, and borrowing. These concepts are
rooted in how memory is managed.
Rust has a steeper learning curve, so aim to reduce friction and fear of failure.
Prerequisites (Mindset & Skills)
Category What to Know or Prepare
Basic Programming At least 6 months experience in any language
Memory Concepts Basic stack vs heap knowledge
Error Handling Understand try/catch, panic vs recover ideas
CLI Usage Comfortable with terminal, basic cargo usage
Ownership/References Read or watch an intro on "Rust Ownership" model
Common Weaknesses / Struggles
Weakness Area We Overcome it
Ownership & Borrowing Offer visual diagrams + real-world analogies
Lifetimes Avoid too early; introduce only with functions
Tooling Complexity Walk through cargo, clippy, fmt slowly
Fear of Compiler Errors Teach how to read and appreciate them
No Garbage Collector Explain with memory safety demos

MODULE
● Purpose of modules in rust code
● Defining own custom module
● private and public visibility of members in a module
● use keyword for deep modules
● super and self keyword
ARRAY TYPES
C++ VS RUST
Tuple data type
● Array data type
● Slice data type
Error Handling
panic. Panic values `abort` and `unwind`
● Option and unwrap
● Result. Iterating over Results
● Multiple error types
Day 3
Introduction to generics
● Defining generic functions
● Making implementation generic
● Defining Bounds for generic type
● The newtype idiom
● Item association
● Phantom type parameters
Introduction to traits in Rust
● Derivable traits
● `dyn` keyword
● Operator overloading using traits
● Drop trait

DATA STRUCTURES
Box type
● Vectors
● Strings
● Option
● Result
● HashMap
● Rc and Arc
Similar to C FFI, I suggest to cover C++ FFI. since C++ is based on class, objects, STL,
exceptions and templates, which requires a different thought process to work with it.

● Box<T> for data on the heap
● The Deref and Drop trait
● Rc<T> and RefCell<T>
Hands on code.

Day 5
Rust for block chain
🧱 1. Contract Architecture & State Management
● Persistent Storage: Understand how to manage on-chain state using data structures
like HashMap, Vec, and custom structs.
● Serialization: Master serialization and deserialization with serde or borsh, as these
are essential for storing and retrieving contract state.
● Entry Points: Define clear and secure public methods for contract interaction.
🔐 2. Security Best Practices
● Ownership & Access Control: Implement role-based access controls to restrict
function access appropriately.
● Error Handling: Utilize Rust's Result and Option types for robust error management.
● Common Vulnerabilities: Be aware of issues like unchecked arithmetic operations,
reentrancy attacks, and improper input validation.
Working with Databases
🔗 Interacting with APIs
Smart contracts often need to communicate with external services to fetch data or trigger
actions. In Rust, this is typically achieved through:
● HTTP Clients: Libraries like reqwest or hyper are used to make HTTP requests to
external APIs.
● Blockchain APIs: For Ethereum, crates like ethers-rs or web3 allow interaction with
the blockchain, enabling functionalities such as querying contract states or sending
transactions. CoinsBench
● Custom APIs: Building RESTful APIs using frameworks like axum or actix-web enables
your dApp to serve data to front-end applications or other services
● Working with a SQL Database
● Serving a JSON API
● Testing and Building
Day 6
Rust for Linux
🧩 Writing Kernel Modules in Rust
● Creating Basic Kernel Modules: Start by writing simple "Hello World" modules in
Rust to understand the kernel module infrastructure.
● Interfacing with C Code: Learn how to interface Rust code with existing C kernel
APIs, which is essential for driver development.
HANDSON PROJECT
🛠 Project: Build a Simple Blockchain in Rust
Objective: Create a basic blockchain that includes blocks, hashing, proof-of-work mining, and
validation
Key Concepts:
● Blocks: Each block contains data, a timestamp, and a hash of the previous block.
● Hashing: Securely link blocks using cryptographic hashes.
● Mining: Implement a simple proof-of-work algorithm to add new blocks.
● Validation: Ensure the integrity of the blockchain by verifying the chain's validity.
Tools:
● Rust: Programming language for building the blockchain.
● SHA-256: Cryptographic hash function for hashing block data.
● Cargo: Rust's package manager and build system.
